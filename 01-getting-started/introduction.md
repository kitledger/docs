# Kitledger

Kitledger is a framework for building transactional software based on double entry accounting.

## Is it an ERP?

No, Kitledger is not an ERP. Instead it is a fantastic tool to use if you are looking to craft a customized ERP system for your business.

However building an ERP system, even with great tooling, is a massive undertaking and as such Kitledger is not limited to *only* building ERP systems but rather any kind of system that benefits for double entry accounting principles.

In fact, the most valuable way to use Kitledger as a complement to an organization's existing ERP system by providing transactional structure to departments and business processes that might not be at a given point in time, properly supported by the main platform.
